Heyo!

The purpose of this is to create a python script that will spit out the geometry for a CNC wood router. This CNC router will use MDF/plywood, use belts for X and Y, use a screw for Z, and be controlled by NEMA23 motors. The script will enable tweaking without touching CAD, not to mention far better book keeping for future changes/tweaks.

I did have a complicated versioning scheme. Now I'm using Git... If you want the latest and greatest, grab the FreeCADRouter script. Individual tweaks will have their own git branches.
