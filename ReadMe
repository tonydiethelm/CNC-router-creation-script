Heyo!

The purpose of this is to create a python script that will spit out the geometry for a CNC wood router. This CNC router will use MDF/plywood, use belts for X and Y, use a screw for Z, and be controlled by NEMA23 motors. The script will enable tweaking without touching CAD, not to mention far better book keeping for future changes/tweaks.

Organization
The latest "stable" router script will be here, as well as the lastest tinkering version. Versioning is done by which build I'm on (3rd router), which major idea of that router I'm on (currently B, which differs from A in how the belts are attached), and a version number (1 as of this writing) to seperate the tinkering version from the Oh God Don't Touch It It Mostly Works version. 

I suppose that since I'm now using GIT, I really don't need to do this any more...

As well, there are DXF (CAD) files in mm and inches for the lastest stableish version.
