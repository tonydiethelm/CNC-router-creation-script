# This is an attempt to create a FreeCad macro to create all the parts for my CNC router.






# Rough Draft

#load part module

#create a new document

#Do all the algebra calcs for the parts

#create an offset vector variable
	#offset

#For Each Part
	# Do the math.
	#create size, location, etc variables
		#size   will contain three points. lower left, upper right, and MDF size. For the main part only
		#holes   contains locations, radii, MDF size of all the bolt holes to be drilled in the part
		#locations   contains lower left, upper right, and MDF of all the slidey holes to be cut.

	#create a box representing the piece of MDF, correctly sized, at offset.
		#use offset and size

	#create cylinders representing the holes to be drilled, properly placed, with offset.
		#use offset, locations(add in offset to make correct) and radii

	#create boxes representing the slidey holes to be cut, properly placed, with offset.
		#use offset, locations

	#subtract all of the cylinders and boxes from the first piece. recompute the shape
		#I deeply suspect I should do this after each part.

#show it on the screen. Think this is done by the recompute.

#save it
